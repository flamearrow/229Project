*) run the existing alrorithms once -done
	*) figure out how to run a small portion of testing data -done
		*) how data is read and split -done

*) convert our data into training data format -done

*) generate training data using pickle: https://www.python.org/doc/2.5/lib/module-cPickle.html -no need
    *) https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html -done

*) this is models the paper for the cnn archetecture: https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks.pdf -done


*) figure out how to terminate from gradient descent -done
    *) can set max step

*) figure out how to use tensor board

*) learn this shit learningtensorflow.com

*) streamline the process:
    *) 880 picture-label as training data, 50 picture-label as test data
    *) convert these into training_data and test_data binary batches
    *) run the algorithm for X steps for training_data batch
    *) evaluate performance

*) stitch output back to a midi file

*) search for monotone midis like flute

*) how to select training data
